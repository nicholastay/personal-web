At the moment, I frequently use a desktop, a laptop and a 'server' (of sorts). I'll list them based on the hostnames I gave them... there's a story behind each of them usually, but I'll keep them to myself :)

With regards to the laptops, I primarily use the MacBook Air.

## Work

I use the given MacBook Pro (M1 Max), and keep these below accessories at my office desk, daily drive them there.

- MOUSE: Logitech MX Vertical
- KEYBOARD: Keebio Iris Rev. 5 (HMX Sillyworks Hyacinth V2) *(for productivity)*
    - Thanks to my mates for the birthday switches! <3
    - Self-assembled with Mill-Max hotswap sockets
    - Tented with some cheap adjustable adhesive legs (works surprisingly well)
    - Custom FR4 board based on official GitHub DXF files (*maybe I should do a post on this soon of how I did the Gerber conversions, etc?*)
- EARPHONES: MOONDROP ARIA Snow Edition (thanks to those same guys for this birthday present too!)
