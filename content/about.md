Hey, I'm Nicholas Tay -- but feel free to call me Nick.

Simply put: final year student at Monash University, working towards finishing a double Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Commerce (Finance major). Enjoy messing with technology, especially a good challenge to learn new things, particularly with software.

Recently, I've been really into virtualisation, containerisation, and more within that space -- I'm still learning! I've got some experience writing programs in C<sup>#</sup>, C and Java, as well as some scripting experience in Shell/Bash, JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js) and Python 2/3. In terms of the 'cloud', I've been picking up Google Cloud Platform, including Firebase (Cloud Functions/Firestore), BigQuery, Cloud Run/Scheduler and more.

In my free time, I really enjoy listening to [some music](https://www.last.fm/user/n2468txd) and play some video games -- at the moment, it happens to be Genshin Impact ([profile](https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/community-game-records-sea/index.html?user_id=19309289#/ys)).

I guess that's about it for now, but I'll be trying to post more on [my blog](/posts) about things I mess with in my spare time, probably with regards to my homelab!

If you'd like to reach out to me about anything **business or security related**, please don't hesitate to contact me via **email** as on the list of socials under my name. For anything else, reach out to me on any **other platform** over there!
