# Computer Setups

At the moment, I frequently use a desktop, 2 laptops and a 'server' (of sorts). I'll list them based on the hostnames I gave them... there's a story behind each of them usually, but I'll keep them to myself :)

With regards to the laptops, I just use what I feel like on the day.
